# DATA 250 Final Project 
This repository was my final project for DATA 250, Topics in Programming: Python. It is forked from the Washington Post data-police-shootings repository (linked below). This repository contains analysis of police shootings data beginning in 2015. It was an extremely interesting project to complete, as I have never extensively explored this sort of data. It was extremely fulfilling to complete as it was a true culmination of all the Python data skills I had learned!
